## Train Station Queue Simulation

This is a Java command-line application that simulates a veeery basic train station's operational workflow. 

Is it fun and realistic? Absolutely not! But it implements a Queue data structure. 

The user can:

- Create a train station
- Add new trains
- Remove trains from the queue (FIFO). If a train has a technical problem, it won't leave the station until it's repaired
- Add passengers to the train at the front of the queue
- View the details of the train at the front of the queue
- View how many trains are in the queue


The app uses the *java.util* library.

If you have Java installed, you can try the app by following those steps:
1. Download the files in a folder
2. Compile them with   `javac *.java`
3. Run the command    `java main`
